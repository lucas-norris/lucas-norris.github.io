        <h3>Difference between HTML, CSS, and JS:</h3>
          <br>
        <p>You can think of these three as the skeleton, the skin, and the muscles of a website. 
          HTML gives structure to a website and defines the content, CSS provides the styling, and JS provides the interactivity. </p>
          <br>
         <h3>Control flow and loops:</h3> 
          <br>
        <p>Control flow is how a computer runs code from the top to bottom. Code is generally run from the first line to the last line. This can change if the computer runs into a statement that changes the control flow, like conditionals, functions, and loops. </p>  
          <br>
        <p>A real-world example of this would be watching something on a streaming service. When you have a show to watch you will generally watch the episodes in order. If you finish a particular show, or run our of episodes, you look/loop through the list of shows until you find another one that catches your eye. </p>  
          <br>
        <h3>The DOM:</h3>  
          <br>
        <p>The DOM is what ties our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together. It is the most important tool we can use while working on HTML documents.</p>  
        <img class="blog-post-image" src="../img/DOM.jpeg" alt="Diagram of the HTML Document Object Model">
          <br>
        <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is the structure of a web document, as displayed by your browser. It is made up of nodes, a node is anything and everything in the DOM. These nodes can be elements, attributes text content etc. The object hierarchy starts with a global window object, then the document object. The document object is the gateway to HTML elements, which is what we mainly work with.</p>  
          <br>
        <h4>Example of how we might interact with it:</h4>  
        <p>We interact with it using JavaScript. It allows us to find HTML elements by class or id and then manipulate them using JavaScript. We can change the text in p elements or execute functions after a button is clicked. </p> 
        <pre class="code">
          <span class="code-text">document.getElementById('element')</span>
          <span class="code-text">document.getElemetnByClassName('element')</span>
        </pre> 
          <br>
        <h3>Difference between accessing data from arrays and objects:</h3>  
          <br>
        <p><strong>Objects</strong> are mainly used to represent something that is made up of a set of characteristics. The characteristics are called properties and consist of a key and a value. We use the keys to access the information in our objects with either dot or bracket notation. </p>  
        
        <p>Dot notation is mainly used, but bracket notation can be handy if we want to include spaces or start with numbers, as bracket notation only requires property identifiers to be a string.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Arrays</strong> are used whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items in one variable.</p>
          <p>Arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first item in an array has an index of zero. We use the position of items in the array to access the data.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>What are functions:</h3>
          <br>
          <p>Simply put, a function is a block of code thatâ€™s designed to perform a particular task. They need to be called to be executed. </p>
          <p>Functions are the workhorses of JavaScript. Instead of having to type out the same code multiple times, functions allow you to store a bit of code that does a single task in a defined block and call it whenever you need with just a short command.</p>
