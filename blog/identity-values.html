    <li><h3>My core values include equality, integrity, and honesty.</h3></li>
    <br>
    <ul>

      <li>A few years ago I was struggling with the decision to continue eating meat or to make a change to a plant based diet. This was a difficult ethical decision for me, as I felt strongly that by eating meat I was complicit. I had to decide whether or not I was alright with being somewhat responsible for the animals life/death. I weighed up what I knew about the food industry and factory farming practices, and my cultural and personal dietary preferences. In the end I decided to embrace a plant-based lifestyle. This decision helped solve some personal ethical dilemmas I had, dilemmas about life itself and how I wanted to live. I felt better after making the decision, less conflicted.</li>
      <br>

      <li>It's hard to say how my culture has influenced my values and identity. I grew up in the US but moved around a bit because my Dad was in the military. I'm half German and half American. My family moved to New Zealand when I was 16, so I did a lot of my growing up here. I don't have a strong singular cultural identity. I feel part New Zealander, part American, and part German, yet I also feel like an outsider in each of those cultures. I am somehow a bit of all of them but none of them. I guess this feeling of being a bit of an outsider has influenced me by being very open to people's differences. I'm excited by people from different backgrounds, and feel that the tech space is also very welcoming and inclusive of people from diverse backgrounds. My experiences have taught me that no matter who we are or where we are from, there is always common ground to be found.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li><h3>Description of strengths and limitations concerning learning.</h3></li>
<ul>
<li>According to the evidence (high5test) my strengths are focussing on what's most important, ability to resolve conflicts, learn new things, develop people's potential, and act and initiate action. My personality type according to 16personalities.com is INFJ-A or Advocate. My strengths have allowed me to learn things I am interested in and complete large projects. My biggest limitation has been trying to keep track of everything, which has overwhelmed me in the past. </li>
<br>

<li>I believe the ability to focus on what's most important will help me in my current learning journey, as I can focus intently on problems and exercises without getting distracted. This will help me when I hit obstacles and get blocked or confused. I'll break the problems down until they are small enough to be solved and then address them one at a time.</li>
<br> 

<li>At a previous job I had to work in a team setting where everyone had different roles. This meant that some people may be busy while others weren't. I had to work productively with them and also work on my own projects. One of the other employees liked to chat and would distract other team members. I tried to find common ground with the chatty team member and explain to then politely that we would love to chat but sometimes our free time didn't sync up with theirs. This was somewhat effective, but the person just seemed to give me space while still annoying other team members. The best strategy may have been to have a small group meeting for the whole team to discuss things in general terms.</li>
