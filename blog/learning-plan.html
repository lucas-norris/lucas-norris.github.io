        <h3>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>My long term plan is still to become a full stack web developer, preferably working for a startup. I would like to be part of a project and see it come to fruition over time.</li>
          <br>
          <li>My main strengths and limitations haven't really changed.  </li>
          <br>
          <li>My biggest non-technical challenge will be working in groups and being around lots of people all day. I tend to need time to recharge and prefer smaller group settings.</li>
          <br>
          <li>I would like to develop my teamwork within groups..</li>
          <br>
          <li>I expect the bootcamp team to be open and supportive and to make the experience as stress free as possible.</li>
          <br>
          <li>I expect to give this bootcamp 110%. I know it won't be easy and will ensure that I do everything in my power to learn as much as possible and to enjoy the experience. I am committed to managing my workload in a timely and efficient manner. I will write out my daily goals and reflect on the progress I make on a daily basis. I'll also practice mindfulness and try my best to be aware of what's going on internally with myself and others.</li>
          <br>
          <li>I will seek help asap when I feel stuck or am struggling with a concept.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Foundations Learning Plan</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>My long term plan is to become a full stack web developer</li>
          <br>
          <li>My main strength when it comes to learning is the ability to set goals and focus. My main limitation is that I struggle being present at times. You can read more about my strengths and limitations <a href="identity-values.html">here</a> </li>
          <br>
          <li>I would like to get better at asking the right questions and communicating with my peers.</li>
          <br>
          <li>I am committed to managing my workload in a timely manner. I have started using pomodoro timers and toggle to keep track of my time while working, this has helped keep me on track. If I run into any issues and find that things are mounting up, I'll be sure to reach out to my facilitator asap and make use of the many helpful discord channels.</li>
          <br>
          <li>I'll seek help from other students, discord channels, and my facilitator if/when I need it. I'll reach out if I get stuck on something for longer than 20 minutes.</li>
          <br>
          <li>I expect the facilitators to be friendly, helpful, and available.</li>
          <br>
          <li>I am available all week.</li>
