          <h3>Three new things I have learned about myself and my ego due to the core learning:</h3>
            <div class ="list">
              <ol>
                <li>
                It's hard for me to open myself up to strangers, It usually takes me a long time to open up. The Identity and values exploration and introduction exercises were, consequently a challenge, but they also helped me understand some things about myself.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                Putting together a learning plan and setting goals for the day has been tremendously helpful. I also find that reflecting on what I have learned a the end of the day is a crucial part of cementing that learning.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                Learning about Nueroplasticity and the growth mindset has helped me understand that I can learn anything I put my mind to, and just because I don't know something now doesn't mean I can't figure it out in time.
                </li>
              </ol>
          </div>
            
              
              
          <h3>The role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming:</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              <p>
                Values, empathy, and self-awareness play valuable roles when it comes to learning and programming. You need to have empathy and self awareness when you ar learning new things and not beat yourself up when you get stuck or don't understand something. This is especially true when getting stuck on coding challenges. Programmers generally work with others, so these play an equally important role when working with others to solve problems. 
              </p>
            </div>
            
            
          <h3>What has surprised me the most about the core learning:</h3>
            <div class ="list">
              <ul>
                <li><h4>Meditation:</h4></li>
                  <p>
                    I was pleasantly surprised to see this included, it has helped me through the frustrating parts of learning to code.
                  </p>
                <li><h4>Emotional Intelligence:</h4></li>
                  <p>
                    Becoming more aware of what's going on internally and practicing to regulate it is very important, both personally and professionally. 
                  </p>
                <li><h4>Listening and Looping:</h4></li>
                  <p>
                    This exercise was surprisingly challenging at first, you feel pressure to listen and it can take you away from the present moment. After practicing a bit it was very helpful, it was nice to listen and to be listened to.
                  </p>
                

              </ul>
            </div>
          
          
          <h3>My most challenging aspects of the core learning:</h3>
          <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
              I found writing the blogs to be quite challenging, writing my personal thoughts/reflections etc and publishing them did not come easy at all for me. Definitely an exercise in letting go.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
          <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
              Because these soft skills are tremendously important in the workplace. Not only do they make you a better problem solver, they also ensure that you work better with others. If you are mindful, empathetic, and aware of your own emotions you will be a better person in general.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
          <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
              Absolutely not, I feel that it has helped me not be so hard on myself, and has allowed me to be much more present when working through things. I also feel that it has helped me open up to strangers in a much shorter period of time than usual by causing me to be more accepting of myself and others.
