          <h3>The problem - Finding Scooby:</h3>
            <div class ="paragraph">
              <P>
                This was a challenge where you had to find the door Scooby was hiding behind. It seemed simple enough, at first, but I got completely blocked. Writing the problem out and using pseudocode provided structure to my code, then lots of google research and reading the documentation helped me finally understand how to solve the problem. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I felt tremendously frustrated during the process, but I learned that if a problem completely stumps me I need to break it down into the simplest pieces, then check which part I'm stumped on and research that specific bit. Writing out the problem in plain english, and solving it in plain english on a piece of paper helped me figure out what code I needed to solve the problem.
              </P>

          <h3>Elegantly solving a problem:</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              <p>
                There was no elegance for me this week, but the closest I came was on a problem where we had to capitalize the first letter of every word. After a good amount of goolging I understood which methods we had to use, and when I finally pieced it all together the feeling was magical. I learned that google is your friend, and that you can find the necessary information to fill in your knowledge gaps. I also learned that I have soooooo much more to learn haha.

          <h3>Problem Solving Techniques:</h3>
            <div class ="list">
              <ul>
                <li><h4>Pseudocode:</h4></li>
                  <p>
                    I'm slowly getting used to writing pseudocode. It can be tremendously helpful to write out what you need each bit of code to do, then you can focus on solving each little step instead of getting overwhelmed by the larger problem. 
                  </p>
                <li><h4>Trying Something:</h4></li>
                  <p>
                    I'm very comfortable with trying things, but too much trial and error can confuse me and then I have to start at the beginning again.
                  </p>
                <li><h4>Rubber Ducky Method:</h4></li>
                  <p>
                    I used this a little bit, it did help me understand the problem when I tried to explain it
                  </p>
                <li><h4>Reading Error Messages:</h4></li>
                  <p>
                    This was an incredibly important step for me, it helped me understand why my code wasn't working and where the issue was. 
                  </p>
                <li><h4>Console.logging:</h4></li>
                  <p>
                    This is a crucial step, it let me see what the actual output of my code was, compared to what I expected the code to do.
                  </p>
                <li><h4>Googling:</h4></li>
                  <p>
                    Probably the single most important part of my problem solving process. This helped me find the documentation for different methods and helped me understand why my code had to include certain things.
                  </p>
                <li><h4>Asking Peers for Help:</h4></li>
                  <p>
                    It can definitely be helpful to discuss your issues with others. I talked to some of my peers, it helps release the frustration and can provide valuable insight.
                   </p>
                <li><h4>Asking Coaches for Help:</h4></li>
                  <p>
                    I'm not that comfortable asking them for help at this stage. I feel like I have to be really stuck and have exhausted all other problem solving techniques before asking them for help.
                   </p>
                <li><h4>Improving Your Process With Reflection:</h4></li>
                  <p>
                    This is incredibly important, this is how you learn from all your mistakes and improve.
                   </p>
