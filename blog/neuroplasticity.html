            <li><h3>Neuroplasticity:</h3></li>
            <br>
            <ul>
        <li>Understanding the principles of neuroplsticity benefits people in a number of ways. It helps remove self critical judgements and provides self confidence. We are not limited, we can learn and we can grow. Understanding that our brains can form new connections and can change helps us understand that we can achieve things we perhaps never thought we could. We shouldn't write ourselves off just because a certain skill doesn't come naturally.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The principles of neuroplasticity tell us that practice really does make perfect. Through practice we engage neural pathways, the more we engage these pathways the stronger they get. If we want to get better at something we have to practice it. Time and intensity also matters, so one can use these principles of neuroplasticty to set up a training program to improve at any skill. Whether that be a sport, mathematics, typing, or playing a musical instrument. It comes down to understanding that you can create new pathways and improve through practice.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Increasing your neuroplasticity requires intentional effort. Choosing an activity that is new and challenging, and then engaging in that activity as frequently as you can, will improve your neuroplasticity. Combining this with other healthy lifestyle choices - a healthy diet, exercise, sleep, and regular social interaction, will also help increase neuroplasticity naturally. Engaging in a variety of activities like travel, making music, learning a new language, all work. It really comes down to continuously learning throughout your life.</li>

        <li>I found this article from verywellmind.com particularly useful: <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886" target="_blank">What is Neuroplasticity</a></li>
              </ul>

        <li><h3>Growth Mindset:</h3></li>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Growth mindset is the belief that you can learn things even if you don't know them yet. Just because you don't know something now doesn't mean you will never know, it just means you don't know whatever it is <strong>yet</strong>. You can learn anything you set your mind to. It's relevant because having a growth mindset here at EDA will help us overcome our self-imposed limitations. Instead of getting upset when we come across a challenge that seems too much for us, it allows us to use those instances as a springboard for growth and development.</li>
          <br>
          <li>It surprised me how ingrained the belief that we just aren't good a certain things is, and how limiting those thoughts can be. I never thought I was a tech savvy person and consequently always put tech stuff into the too hard box. It wasn't until I gave it a go that I realised my preconceptions were false. I have learned that I need to work on shifting my perspective to a growth mindset, and be mindful of the negative thoughts that arise when things get challenging.</li>
          <br>
          <li>I will integrate the growth mindset into my learning journey through daily mindfulness meditation. It will be helpful for me to think about the growth mindset on a daily basis before I start working not eh curriculum in the mornings. </li>
          <br>
          <li>I enjoyed the TED talk by Carol Deck: <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve#t-459099" target="_blank">The Power of Believing That You Can Improve</a>, and other videos by her on the topic. </li>
        </ul>
          <br>
<li><h3>How to implement in learning plan:</h3></li>
<br>
<p>I'm going to add more breaks, exercise, and mindfulness practice into my learning plan to improve my neuroplasticity during this course.</p>
